                Paperfell is a first person puzzle game developed in Unity with a team of 5 game devs over the course of approximately 6 weeks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After Joining Paperfell partway through development due to outside factors, I was left to undertake rolls that I was unfamiliar with that ended up rounding out my skills in some areas and making me more knowledgeable in others.

                Due to limited asset packs online that would fit the artistic vision that the team had for paperfell. I was left with minimal other choices than to attempt to apply the skills I had learnt in another class that taught the basics of unity including the animation module and other skills,
                Furthermore, a heavy emphasis was placed on the sound design and level aethetic of each of the rooms with an emphasis being placed on ensuring the individual rooms helped create a sense of Immersion with the player.

            <p>
                If the opportunity Arrose to Recomplete this project with the same team, the application of probuilder would be greatly reduced in favour of other asset creation methods as it negatively affected the performance of the game.
