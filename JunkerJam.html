                JunkerJam is a side-scroller Dance Dance Revolution-style game where the user competes against the computer. Both the player and the computer have abilities to either power up their own gameplay or hinder their opponent.
                This game was submitted to the Ubisoft 2024 Australian Game Jam, and I was the Director, Game Designer, and Co-Programmer for this project.

                As my first project in the rhythm game genre, this game challenged my skills as a Director, Programmer, and Designer. 
                There were multiple aspects of the genre that I was simply not familiar with, and I underestimated the commitment it would involve. This led to additional mechanics being developed, which quickly increased the scope beyond what was feasible.

                Due to my lack of experience in game development as a whole, most of the abilities appeared as numbers games, with a lack of user feedback that left players in the dark regarding the results of their actions.
                Furthermore, the system that measures the player's success was limited. After further reading and watching several video essays on the inner workings of rhythm games, 
                I have learned about other slightly more complex yet far more gratifying methods of point calculation that could take its place.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the expedited nature of learning a new game genre and my first experiences with features like singletons, the programming of the game could benefit from significant improvement.
                 There was a high level of coupling and unnecessary use of singletons, which I improved upon in later game development projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some interpersonal conflicts arose over the course of the project, many of which could have been easily avoided with proper project management software and techniques, such as the Scrum method or the use of Trello or Jira to keep track of workflow.
            </p>
                
                While there are certainly aspects of this project that could be improved, the skills it taught me and the people I worked with were extraordinary. I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to direct this game.
